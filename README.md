## Loot System (Modified DKP)

### Full Guild Run

A [vickery auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction) is held for each piece of gear loot dropped. 
- This is a sealed, single bid system. Other players will not know how much another player has bid for a given item.
- The loot master will put an item up for auction with a minimum price, which by default is 2-DKP unless specified otherwise.
- Each player will have 40 seconds to place ONE bid.
- The player with the highest bid pays the value of the second highest bid and wins the item.
- In the event of a tie the player with the highest total pool of DKP wins the bid and pays the highest amount bid.
- In the event only a single player bids on a given item that player pays the minimum price and wins the item.
- The loot master has the right to deny players right to roll on a given item for the following reasons:
  - The item is not for the players current main spec.
  - The item is not an upgrade for the players currently equipped item and no reasonable argument can be made as to how this item can be useful for a given player.

The following items excptions and are handled as follows:
- Recipies: 
  - The first drop of a new recipie automatically goes to the guild crafter for that profession.
  - Second drop and beyond will be placed up for `/roll` amoung crafters of that profession.
  - If no crafter needs the recipie the loot master will `/roll 40` and give the recipie to the corresponding player in the raid.
- Legendaries:
  - Drops for legendary items will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. If a player wishes to be included in consideration they should make it known prior to the item dropping.
  - There are no hard and fast metrics by which players are considered for this loot type but the following list are activities which improve chances of being chosen for one of these extremely rare items.
    - Consistent positive contribution to raid. Showing up on time, buffed, and performing class duties above expectations while maintaining an encouraging/fun attitude.
    - Participating in guild management in an active manner.
    - Helping other guildies become better though assisting in their gear grind, providing class/addon tips, or suggesting learning resources.

### Guild Hosted PUG Run

Non-reserved items will be `/roll`'ed. Highest roll wins the item. In the event of a tie, the tied players will re-roll and highest roll wins the item.

For reserved items we will fallback to the same loot rules as outlined in the "Full Guild Run" section.

// NOTE: Chat with Titanas about this. The pinned comment talks about a 4 DKP max gain per week through this method but then Black lotus is priced 12 DKP. Unsure how to clairify the rules around this better.
